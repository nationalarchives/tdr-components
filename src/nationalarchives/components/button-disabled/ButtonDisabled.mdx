# Button (disabled)

This component is a very simple implementation of a [GDS Button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/) but using `aria-disabled` instead of `disabled`. Using the `disabled` attribute removes keyboard focus when tabbing, which is particularly unhelpful for keyboard-only users.

`aria-disabled` however maintains the keyboard tabbing focus but does not prevent the button from being submitted. We have therefore added Javascript to prevent the button submission if `aria-disabled` is `true`. Some research relating to this:
